This repository demonstrates a subtle HTML error that can easily be missed. The bug involves attempting to access a non-existent attribute using the getAttribute() method. While it does not throw an error, it returns null, which might lead to unexpected behavior or logic errors within your script. The solution provides a method for checking the existence of the attribute before attempting to access it.  This robust approach prevents unexpected null pointer-like issues.
